# Battleship

An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship)

*"Test Driven Development can certainly feel uncomfortable at first, but becomes more natural with practice. We’re going to implement the classic game ‘Battleship’. We should know our code is coming together by running tests. You shouldn’t be relying on console.logs or DOM methods to make sure your code is doing what you expect it to."*
